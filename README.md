# algorithms
This repository is a collection of widely used algorithms like for sorting, trees, graphs etc. in C#.

I have tried my best to keep it very simple and optimize these to the best possible extent. 

Please feel free to create PR if you think there's more optimizations possible in terms of space and time.
