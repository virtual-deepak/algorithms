# Algorithms
This repository aims to be a collection of widely used core algorithm strategies like for sorting, trees, graphs etc. Also, code solutions to problems as I come along. 

I have tried my best to keep it very simple and optimize these to the best possible extent. 

Please feel free to create PR if you think there's more optimizations possible in terms of space and time. Also, in case you have any more algorithms and solutions to contribute (any langauge, refactored enough to ensure simplicity to understand with test cases)
