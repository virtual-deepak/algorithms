# Basic mathematics
Some basic mathematics to be known to derive the complexity of the algorithms etc.  

## Sum of first 'n' numbers
S = 0 + 1 + 2 + ..... + (n-1)<br>
S = (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-2) + ..... + 0
2S = 0 + n + n + n + ...... + 0 <br> 
*....n is counted (n-1) times*<br>
2S = n(n-1)<br>
S = n(n-1)/2<br>
